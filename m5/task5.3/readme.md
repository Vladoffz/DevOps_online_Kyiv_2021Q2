Proc is a very unusual folder. It doesn't exist on disk or even in RAM. 
All subdirectories, files and information stored in them are generated by the kernel on the fly, as soon as you request it. 
Only this folder contains files of zero size. And also each file will have the current creation date.

User-space processes have its own virtual address space.

Kernel processes or threads do not have their own address space, they operate within kernel address space only. 
And they may be started before the kernel has started any user process.

Commands top, atop, htop, pstree, ps aux.

The ps command lists the current processes on your server. Usually used in conjunction with the grep command and more or less.

Jobs command is used to list the jobs that you are running in the background and in the foreground.

bg is a task control command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that resumes execution of a suspended process in the background, 
the resuming process continues to run in the background without the user entering any commands from the terminal.

The fg command switches a job running in the background into the foreground.

Nohup, short for no hang up is a command in Linux systems that keep processes running even after exiting the shell or terminal. 
Nohup prevents the processes or jobs from receiving the SIGHUP (Signal Hang UP) signal. 
This is a signal that is sent to a process upon closing or exiting the terminal.

Using sleep, fg, bg and jobs commands:
